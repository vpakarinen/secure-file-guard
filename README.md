- Add, extract, and list files with encrypted metadata
- Comprehensive error handling and logging

## How It Works

- Creates an encrypted vault secured by your password and a unique salt
- Files are encrypted using AES-256 and stored in a secure container
- Password verification and key derivation ensure vault security
- Files can be safely added to or extracted from the vault
- All operations maintain file integrity and metadata security
- Files can be safely added to or extracted from the vault
